# "Interpretation Rules.txt"

# Adobe After Effects Automatic Footage Interpretation

# blank lines are allowed, and lines beginning with "#" are comments

# basic format of a hard rule: {match requirements} = {set interpretation}
# basic format of a soft rule: {match requirements} ~ {set interpretation}

# + for each rule that matches, the interpretation is set; wild-cards ("*") allowed
#	on both sides; wildcard match matches anything, wildcard set sets nothing
# + multiple rules are allowed to match, later matches override earlier matches
# + all rules are scanned in order, one rule per line
# + rules are applied after pixel aspect ratio, alpha information, and field label
#	information is read from a file

# + soft rules will not override values that are specified explicitly by the file
#	format or set by previous rules

# width, height, frame-rate, file-type, codec =
#	pixel aspect ratio/name, field order, conform frame-rate, alpha interp, icc profile code
#	or profile description (one or the other), linear light

# width & height are integer numbers
# frame-rate is a decimal number
# file-type is four characters in quotes (FourCC)
# codec (applicable for QT & AVI only) is also FourCC

# to find out the file-type and/or codec FourCC's for a specific type of footage,
#	opt-click (Mac) or alt-click (Windows) on the footage in the project window;
#	the FourCC codes will appear in the last line of text by the thumbnail

# the pixel aspect ratio is a ratio of integers (e.g. 10/11)
#	optionally followed by a name for that ratio (e.g. 10/11/"My Aspect")
# In After Effects CS4 (v9) we modified the Pixel Aspect Ratio's for several common formats:
#	D1/DV NTSC From 648/720 (0.9) to 10.0/11.0 (about 0.9091)
#	D1/DV NTSC Widescreen from 6/5 (1.2) to 40/33 (about 1.2121)
#	D1/DV PAL From 768/720 (1.07) to 768/702 (about 1.0940)
#	D1/DV PAL Widescreen from 64/45 (1.42) to 1024.0/702.0 (about 1.4587)

# the field order is a single character, (F=frame, U=upper field, or L=lower field)
# the conform frame-rate is a decimal number
# alpha interp: (I=ignore, S=straight, P=premul/black, W=premul/white)
#	alpha interp is ignored for footage without an alpha channel

# ICC profile is specified either by profile code which is FourCC or by
#	profile description which is a string in quotes with at most 255 characters plus quotes

# The supported profile codes are:
#	- working space profile: "wRGB"
#	- embedded profile: "embe"
#	- preserve RGB: "pRGB" (this does exactly what Preserve RGB checkbox does in Interpret Footage dialog)
#	- sRGB: "sRGB"
#	- Adobe RGB: "AS98"
#	- Kodak 5218 film profile: "ginp"
#	- SDTV NTSC: "r6nf" (SMPTE RP 145 primaries and ITU-R Rec. 709 TRCs. Black is encoded at 0 and White is encoded at 1.)
#	- SDTV NTSC 16-235: "r6ns" (SMPTE RP 145 primaries and ITU-R Rec. 709 TRCs. Black is encoded at 16/255 and White is encoded at 235/255.)
#	- SDTV PAL: "r6pf" (EBU Tech. 3213 primaries and ITU-R Rec. 709 TRCs. Black is encoded at 0 and White is encoded at 1.)
#	- SDTV PAL 16-235: "r6ps" (EBU Tech. 3213 primaries and ITU-R Rec. 709 TRCs. Black is encoded at 16/255 and White is encoded at 235/255.)
#	- HDTV (Rec. 709): "r7hf" (ITU-R Rec. 709 primaries and TRCs. Black is encoded at 0 and White is encoded at 1.)
#	- HDTV (Rec. 709) 16-235: "r7hs" (ITU-R Rec. 709 primaries and TRCs. Black is encoded at 16/255 and White is encoded at 235/255.)

# The profile description can be looked up either in UI (project window thumbnail info) or in a
# color utility such as ColorSync or it is user-defined when creating a custom profile

# linear light is an integer (0=Off, 1=On, 2=On for 32 bpc footage)
